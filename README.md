ptest.sml - contains bad recursive code to generate permutations
            in no particular order <br/>
isprime.sml - contains bad trial division code for primality testing <br/>
bogosort.sml - Uh <br/>
subsetsum.sml - inefficient subset sum that returns the subset too. but so pretty x.x <br/>
powerset.sml - two pieces of shitty code that both return the power set of a list... in different orders :P <br/>
trees/btree.sig - a signature for a BST <br/>
trees/avltree.sml - An AVL tree implementation of a self-balancing BST
anagrams/trie.sig - a signature for a (latin alphabet) trie <br/>
anagrams/trie.sml - a (very bad) implementation of said trie signature. tbh I don't know if I'm doing this right or not, lol.
